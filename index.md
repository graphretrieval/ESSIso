## Efficient Streaming Subgraph Isomorphism with Graph Neural Networks

### Abstract
We first present a novel subgraph index based on graph embeddings that serves as the foundation for efficient stream processing. It enables not only effective caching and re-use of results, but also speeds-up traditional algorithms for subgraph isomorphism in case of cache misses. Moreover, we propose cache management policies that incorporate notions of reusability of query results. Further details can be found in [this paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p730-duong.pdf)
